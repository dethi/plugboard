          `onSelect` is called whenever a tab is selected. The handler for
          this function will be passed the current index as well as the last index.

          `selectedIndex` is the tab to select when first rendered. By default
          the first (index 0) tab will be selected.

          `forceRenderTabPanel` By default this react-tabs will only render the selected
          tab's contents. Setting `forceRenderTabPanel` to `true` allows you to override the
          default behavior, which may be useful in some circumstances (such as animating between tabs).

              Selecting a tab can be done by either clicking with the mouse,
              or by using the keyboard tab to give focus then navigating with
              the arrow keys (right/down to select tab to the right of selected,
              left/up to select tab to the left of selected).

              The content of the <Tab/> (this.props.children) will be shown as the label.

            <TabPanel/> is the content for the tab.

            There should be an equal number of <Tab/> and <TabPanel/> components.
            <Tab/> and <TabPanel/> components are tied together by the order in
            which they appear. The first (index 0) <Tab/> will be associated with
            the <TabPanel/> of the same index. Running this example when
            `selectedIndex` is 0 the tab with the label "Foo" will be selected
            and the content shown will be "Hello from Foo".

            As with <Tab/> the content of <TabPanel/> will be shown as the content.
